#Iris Classification

Also referred to as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning, the Iris Flowers Dataset has numerical attributes which makes it easier on beginners who'd like to learn about supervised ML algorithms as well as loading and handling of data. As the dataset is small, it doesn't require special transformations or scaling capabilities.
