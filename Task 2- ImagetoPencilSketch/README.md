In this task we take an image and convert it to a pencil sketch using the basics of OpenCV. The process is done by the following steps:

1. Read the image in RGB
2. Convert Image to Grayscale
3. Invert Grayscale Image
4. Enhance using Blur 
5. Invert Blur and divide the Grayscale by Inverted Blur to produce pencil sketch



Language Used - Python, OpenCV 
Software - Google Colab
