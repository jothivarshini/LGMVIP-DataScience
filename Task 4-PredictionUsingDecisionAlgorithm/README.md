# Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm

Decision Tree algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning algorithms

In this task, the goal of a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data(training data).
